# Capstone Proposal

I will continue working on MSDScript, the project that we have worked on in CS6015.

Right now I have no idea what the project will look like when it is done.

## A very rough plan

The plan is be to add more features to MSDScript (duh). Here is the plan in steps:

1. Implement the optional features Matthew talked about at the end of the class.
2. Learn Racket and switch all the C++ code to Racket.
3. Learn some design patterns by reading books; Learn about the desgin of programming languages either by watching videos from another course Matthew taught or by reading books about it. (This is the part where I will need a lot guidance from Matthew). At the same time, apply them to MSDScript.
